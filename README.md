# izel_soc
This FPGA based SoC use ZPUFlex soft core microprocessor and is based on https://github.com/robinsonb5/ZPUDemos
also adds other funcionalities and libraries not abaliable in that project. It is designed to run in a ALTERA DE1
development board, but it is also posible to port to other hardware platform.
